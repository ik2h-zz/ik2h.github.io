        <h2 id="TASK-1"><a href="#TASK-1" class="headerlink" title="TASK 1"></a>TASK 1</h2><p>Thew chart gives information about post-shcool qualifications in terms of the different levels of further education reached by man and women in Australia in 1999.</p>
<p>We can see immediately that there were substantial differences in the proportion of men and women at different levels. The biggest gender difference is at the lowest post-school level, where 90% of those who held a skilled vocational diploma were man, compared with only 10% of women. By contrast, more women held undergraduate diplomas (70%) and marginally more women reached degree level (55%).</p>
<p>At the higher level of education, men with postgraduate diplomas clearly outnumbered their female counterparts (70% and 30%, respectively), and also constituted 60% of Master’s graduates.</p>
<p>Thus we can see that more men than women hold qualifications at the lower and higher levels of education, while more women reach undergraduate diploma level that man. The gender difference is smallest at the level of Bachelor’s degree, however.</p>
<h2 id="TASK-2"><a href="#TASK-2" class="headerlink" title="TASK 2"></a>TASK 2</h2><p>On the specific issue of creative freedom versus government restrictions, I am full of the opinion that latter should give place to the former.</p>
<p>Creation is the soul of art. And creation can only be nurtured in an environment of freedom. Human history has shown that the flourishing eras of artistic works were always those accompanied by great freedom, no matter whether idelogically or politically. These artistic creations enriched people’s spiritual life of the time, left the generations to have a valuable legacy, and overall make a good part of human civilization for ever. Without them, human civilization might take on another look undersirable to us all.</p>
<p>Nearly any restriction is bound to impede artistic expreesion. Of all, the most destructive force is from government with the strong power behind it. Improper government restrictions kill artistic creation. Without artistic creation, people’s spiritual life will be in stagnation. And this will further affect people’s physical life directly or indirectly. Ultimately, the whole society is seen in an appalling state. Those dark ages in human history generally fell into this formula.</p>
<p>Therefore, for more colorful life of human beings, artistic creations should be encouraged in freedom, It is the responsibility of the government to help foster such an art-friendly atmosphere, rather than exert restrictions.</p>

        <h2 id="TASK-1"><a href="#TASK-1" class="headerlink" title="TASK 1"></a>TASK 1</h2><p>The table gives a breakdown of the different typesos family who were living in poverty<br>in Australia in 1999.</p>
<p>On average, 11% of all households, comprising almost two million people, were in this position. However, those consisting of only one parent or a single adult had almost double this proportion poor people, with 21% and 19% respectively.</p>
<p>Couples generally tended to be better off with lower poverty levels for couples without children (7%) than those with children (12%). It is noticeable that for both types of households with children, a higher than average proportion were living in poverty at this time.</p>
<p>Older people were generally less likely to be poor, though once again the trend favoured elderly couples (only 4%) rather than single elderly people (6%).</p>
<p>Overall the table suggests that households of single adults and those with children were more likely to be living in poverty than those consisting of couples.</p>
<h2 id="TASK-2"><a href="#TASK-2" class="headerlink" title="TASK 2"></a>TASK 2</h2><p>Books, radios and films, as different media of communication, vary considerably in the delivery on information and thus in the results prodeced.</p>
<p>Books boast the longest histroy compared with radio programs and films. Books can have a touch upon almost all the aspects of our life. Therefore it is no exaggerating to say that the histroy of books is also the history of human development. But books usually tend to be somewhat slower than the time depicted in them. That may disappoint those who want to acquire the latest information.</p>
<p>Films can be the most artistic among the three forms of media as it combines audio, visual and sometimes even special effects. They can get people involved in a more colorful and real world. But unlike books that can be read in the couch or on the bus, movies will not be avaliable without a ticket to the cinema and are shown only once a time.</p>
<p>In comparison with books and films, radio can provide the fastest source of information. Radio programs offer weather forecast and domestic and international developments in the fileds ranging from presidential election in the U.S. to reform in the banking system in China to protests against humans mistreatment of animals in Europe. Radio is also easier to carry compared with the other two. But in terms of the depth of information carried in it, it is no match for books and films.</p>
<p>In conclusion, books make people think, movies let people enjoy and radio helps people live.</p>

        <h2 id="TASK-1"><a href="#TASK-1" class="headerlink" title="TASK 1"></a>TASK 1</h2><p>The line graph compares the typical daily demands for electricity in winter and summer in England. As can be seen, the electricity consumption in winter almost doubles that in summer at any given moment of a day. The former waves between 30,000 and 45,000 units, while the latter fluctuates between 13,000 and 20,000 units. Their development trends see more similarities than differences. From 0 to 9 o’clock, both curves move generally downward to the lowest points of more than 30,000 units and 13,000 units, and from then on, the two lines go roughly upward, respectively to the highest amount of 45,000 units at 21 o’clock and more than 20,000 units at 13 o’clock.</p>
<p>The pie chart reflects an average household use of electricity in England. Heating for both room and water accounts for the biggest share of more than half. The other half of electricity is almost evenly used for three sections: ovens, kettles, washing, TV, radio; and vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electric tools. The first section consumes a little bit higherof 17.5% while the rest two have an equal share of 15%.</p>
<p>From the two charts, it is clear that electricity is in higher demand in winter in England.</p>
<h2 id="TASK-2"><a href="#TASK-2" class="headerlink" title="TASK 2"></a>TASK 2</h2><p>Happiness in very difficult to define, because it means so many different things to different people. While some people link happiness to wealth and material success, others think it lies in emotions and loving personal relationships. Yet others think that spiritual paths, rather than either the material world or relationships with people, are the only way to true happiness.</p>
<p>Because people interpret happiness for themselves in so many diffenernt ways, it is difficult to give and definition that is true for everyone. However, if there are different kinds of happiness for different individuals then the first step in achieving it would be to have a degree of self-knowledge. A person needs to know who he or she is before being able to know what it is that makes him or her happy.</p>
<p>Of course, factors such as loving relationships, good health, the skills to earn a living and a peaceful environment all contribute to our happiness too. But this does not mean that people without these conditions cannot be happy.</p>
<p>Overall, I think an ability to keep clear perspectives in life is a more essential factor in achieving happinesss. By that I mean an ability to have a clear sense of what is important in our lives (the welfare of our families, the quality of our relationships, making other people happy, etc.) and what is not (a problem at work, getting annoyed about trivial things, etc.)</p>
<p>Like self-awareness, this is also very difficult to achieve, but I think these are the two factors that may be the most important happiness.</p>
